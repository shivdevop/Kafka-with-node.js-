### What is a Kafka Broker?
A broker is a Kafka server that:

Stores and manages topics (data streams)
Handles message storage and retrieval
Coordinates with other brokers in a cluster
Serves client requests (producers/consumers)
Think of it as a "post office" that receives, stores, and delivers messages.
